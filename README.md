# 🌊 Satellite Image Analyzer (Go MVP)

A Go-based implementation of a simplified satellite image analyzer.  
This MVP focuses on grid-based algorithms such as water-body detection,  
flood-fill operations, border-connected expansion, and enclosed-lake identification.

The project is structured using **idiomatic Go module layout** and is written using a **test-driven development (TDD)** workflow.

## 📌 Problem Statement  
You are tasked with building a simplified **satellite image analyzer** to detect and analyze water bodies (e.g., lakes, rivers, flood zones) from satellite images.  

The image is represented as an `m x n` binary grid:  
- `0` = land  
- `1` = water  

Your analyzer should implement algorithms that:  
1. **Count distinct water bodies, water bodies at border can still be considered distinct**  
2. **Find the largest water body (by area)**  
3. **Detect enclosed lakes** (water bodies not touching the grid border)  
4. **Simulate flood risk zones** by expanding from border-connected water bodies  

Input Grid:      Flood Risk Zones (neighbors_8)
1 0 1            X 1 X
0 0 0     =>     1 1 1
1 0 1            X 1 X

Connectivity is defined as **8-directional adjacency**:  
- Horizontal: up, down  
- Vertical: left, right  
- Diagonal: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right  

## 🚀 Features

### 1. Count distinct water bodies  
Uses 8-directional adjacency (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).

### 2. Find the largest water body  
Returns the maximum connected area of water cells.

### 3. Detect enclosed lakes  
A water body is considered enclosed if it does **not** touch the border.

### 4. Simulate flood-risk expansion  
Starting from border-connected water bodies, expand outward using 8-directional adjacency.

## 🧪 Test-Driven Development Workflow

> **Why a dedicated `TDD/` directory?**  

The `TDD/` folder contains the initial tests written for each feature *before* any 
production code exists.  
 
This emphasizes the project's TDD-driven workflow:  
1. Write a failing test  
2. Implement the minimal solution  
3. Refactor while keeping tests green  
 
Keeping TDD tests distinct highlights the iterative design process and demonstrates 
intentional, test-first engineering practices for portfolio reviewers.

Run tests:

```bash
go test ./...
```

Run tests with coverage:

```bash
go test ./... -cover
```

## ▶️ Running the CLI

The CLI entry point will live at:

```
cmd/analyzer/main.go
```

Run it with:

```bash
go run ./cmd/analyzer
```

## 📦 Installation (For Contributors)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/acheampe/satellite_image_analyzer_MVP.git
cd satellite_image_analyzer_MVP
go mod tidy
```

## 📚 Future Enhancements

- Visualization tools (ASCII maps or web UI)  
- Parallel flood-fill using goroutines  
- Heatmap generation  
- REST API wrappers  
- S3/GCP integration for image ingestion
